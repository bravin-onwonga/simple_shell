The shell project is a group project. That means you will be paired with someone. You already did this with printf, so please apply everything you have learned from the printf experience here. A quick reminder, that a group project is NOT:

I do nothing and cross fingers for my partner to do everything so I can have a good score
I do everything because I am so much better than my partner and I don’t care about them
A group project at ALX SE is a project that both of you are responsible for. Everything anyone pushes to Github is the responsibility of both partners. It is not ok to say later “I didn’t cheat it’s my partner I didn’t know they didn’t tell me”.
